# Data dictionary

One section per output file, one row per column. `tests/unit/test_data_dictionary.py` fails
if a column is produced that is not described here.

Everything is under the one `data/` folder, grouped by format: `data/parquet` (the
processed tables), `data/csv` (every CSV: coverage, conflicts, review queues, the annotation
sample), `data/json` (JSON for the frontend) and `data/reports` (the quality report as
Markdown and HTML, and the annotation guide). `data/raw` and `data/interim` are the
pipeline's working folders. Only `manifest.json`, the index of all those files, sits beside
the folder.

Conventions used in every table:

- **Identifiers.** `drug_id` is the InChIKey of the standardised structure, or
  `name:<key>` when no valid structure is known. `cell_line_id` is the DepMap id
  (`ACH-000123`), or `name:<KEY>` when the line could not be mapped.
- **Provenance.** Every table ends with the same five columns, described once here:

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | string | Connector(s) the row comes from, `; `-separated when several contributed |
| `source_url` | string | Where the data was retrieved from (secrets removed) |
| `retrieved_at` | string | UTC time of retrieval, ISO 8601 (`2026-10-13T18:04:11Z`) |
| `source_version` | string | Version of the source: release, record or file id |
| `license` | string | Licence of the source data, as recorded in `LICENSES.md` |

- **Missing values** are nulls, never zeros or empty strings.

## data/parquet/synergy_pairs.parquet

One row per drug pair, cell line, source and study. The pair is unordered: `drug_a_id` is
always the smaller id, so (A, B) and (B, A) are the same row. Replicates inside one study
are averaged. Rows from different sources are **not** merged: pick one per
(`pair_key`, `cell_line_id`) after choosing a score.
