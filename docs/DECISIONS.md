# Decisions

Choices made where the brief was open or where reality differed from it. Each entry says
what was decided and why, so it can be revisited.

## Compliance

**D1. A contact email is required for live requests.** With `http.require_contact_email:
true` (the default) every request is refused until `CONTACT_EMAIL` is set in `.env`. During
the build there was no `.env` yet (the brief says to add it afterwards), so verification
runs used `--set http.require_contact_email=false` and sent the User-Agent
`tujya-data/0.1.0 (research data pipeline; contact not configured)`. Those runs were
kept small: single bulk files and a few dozen API calls.

**D2. robots.txt is checked for bulk downloads too, not only for HTML.** The brief requires
it before HTML fetches. Applying it to file downloads as well is stricter and is what
surfaced D4. Documented REST APIs (E-utilities, PUG-REST, ChEMBL, Europe PMC, PubTator,
Figshare, Dataverse) are governed by their API terms and rate limits instead; switch
`http.robots_for_bulk` off only with a reason. The parser follows RFC 9309 (wildcards, `$`,
longest match) because Python's `urllib.robotparser` gets Zenodo's rules wrong.

**D3. A `Crawl-delay` in robots.txt always slows the client down** (Zenodo 10 s, NCI wiki
15 s), even when the configured rate is faster. All limits also run at 90 % of their value
(`http.safety_factor`) so that clock jitter cannot push a burst over a provider's limit.

**D4. NCI-ALMANAC is a manual download.** Its files are attachments on `wiki.nci.nih.gov`
and that host's robots.txt disallows `/download/`. The connector checks robots.txt on every
run: if NCI ever allows the path it downloads by itself, until then it asks for the file
under `data/manual/nci_almanac/`. While exploring, before the robots.txt files had been
read, about seven small requests were made to that path (two text files and 64-byte ranges
of the zip), one page request to `dtp.cancer.gov` and one README request to
`ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`, both of which serve `Disallow: /`. None was repeated once the rules
were known, and the pipeline itself never requests those paths.

**D4b. The PubMed baseline is a manual download too.** `ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` serves
`Disallow: /` in robots.txt, even though NLM documents it as the bulk download site. The
two statements conflict; the stricter one is followed. The optional baseline connector
reads files placed under `data/manual/pubmed_baseline/`. If the team decides NLM's download
documentation is the applicable policy, `http.robots_for_bulk: false` restores automatic
download, for every bulk source at once, so it should be a deliberate decision.

**D5. DepMap comes from Figshare+, not the portal.** `depmap.org/portal` answers automated
clients with a "verifying you are a person" page and asks not to be scraped. That is an
access control, so it is not worked around. Every DepMap release is also published on
Figshare+ with a documented API, MD5 checksums and a CC BY 4.0 licence; release 24Q4 is
pinned (`article_id: 27993248`).

**D6. The Zenodo record metadata endpoint is not called.** Zenodo's robots.txt disallows
`/api` except `/api/records/*/files`. The file name, size and MD5 of DrugComb v1.4 are
therefore pinned in the connector, and only the allowed file URL is requested.

**D7. GDSC reads the Cell Model Passports model list.** `cancerrxgene.org` answers 410 Gone
and points to Cell Model Passports. The connector is optional and disabled; its licence
could not be verified automatically, so the registry says so instead of guessing.

**D8. DDInter needs an explicit acknowledgement; DrugBank is never requested.** DDInter is
CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, so the connector refuses to download until `terms_acknowledged: true`.
The DrugBank connector has no network code at all: it reads one user-supplied file.

**D9. Access walls are reported, never retried or bypassed.** 401 / 403, a CAPTCHA or a
login page raise `AccessControlError`, which is not retried and opens the source's circuit
breaker at once. The client sends no cookies, refuses `Authorization`, `Cookie` and
forwarding headers, has no proxy pool, and rejects a User-Agent that imitates a browser.

**D10. The client only talks to hosts a connector declares.** A request to any other host
is refused before it leaves. This is what keeps the pipeline a set of source connectors
rather than a general scraper.

**D11. No connector parses HTML.** Every source turned out to have an API or a bulk file.
HTML pages are only probed for their status by `sources --check`. The policy is enforced by
`docs/CODE_REVIEW.md`, the pull-request template and `tests/unit/test_policy.py`.

## Data

**D12. `synergy_pairs` has one row per pair, cell line, source and study.** The brief asks
for one row per drug A, drug B and cell line, with source and study columns, and also that
scores are never merged silently. Both hold only if records from different sources stay on
separate rows. Replicates *within* one study are averaged, with `n_replicates` and `*_std`
kept. `n_sources`, `n_records` and `has_conflict` make it easy to pick one row per triplet
once the project has chosen a score.

**D13. A drug is its standardised structure.** Two names are the same drug when their
desalted, neutralised structures share a full InChIKey; stereoisomers stay distinct. A drug
without a valid structure keeps a name-based id (`name:<key>`), stays in the table with
`smiles_valid = false`, and goes to the review queue. Metal complexes written as separate
fragments (carboplatin) keep all fragments, otherwise the metal would be stripped as a salt.

**D14. Confidence is a fixed scale, not a model.** 1.0 manual override or dataset SMILES
confirmed by PubChem; 0.9 single PubChem hit by name; 0.8 dataset SMILES alone; 0.6 several
PubChem hits (first taken); 0.5 dataset and PubChem disagree; 0.0 unresolved. Anything
below 0.7, or with a stated problem, is queued in `data/csv/drug_review_queue.csv`.
Decisions are fed back through `config/manual_drug_overrides.csv`.

**D14b. Names differing only in a stereo sign are different drugs.** `(+)-JQ1`, `(-)-JQ1`
and `(+/-)-JQ1` are kept apart when matching names. Found on real data: the two
blebbistatin enantiomers had been merged by a key that dropped the signs.

**D14c. Lookups go to the most-measured drugs first.** PubChem and ChEMBL are asked for
drug names in order of how many measurements depend on them, so a partial or `--sample`
run resolves the drugs that matter most.

**D14d. Cell lines are matched to DepMap in tiers.** `StrippedCellLineName` first, then the
display name, then the CCLE-name prefix, and a later tier is only used when the earlier ones
find nothing. Without this, derived lines (`A375_SKIN_CJ1`) made their parent ambiguous.
Six spellings are mapped through `config/cell_line_aliases.csv` (OVCAR3, U251, SR, 786-0,
LNCAP, MSTO); related-but-different lines (MDA-MB-435 vs 435S, EFM192B vs EFM-192A) are
deliberately left unmapped for a person to decide.

**D15. CSS and ALMANAC's ComboScore get their own columns.** They are not Bliss, Loewe, HSA
or ZIP, so mapping them onto one of those would be exactly the silent merge the brief
forbids. CSS measures efficacy, not synergy.

**D16. DrugComb has no study column.** The Zenodo table lacks `study_name` and
`tissue_name`, so `study_id` is null for DrugComb and its overlap with O'Neil, ALMANAC and
TDC is detected by pair and cell line. 709,187 of its 1,175,220 rows are single-drug
screens (second drug `NA`) and are skipped, which was checked against the raw file.

**D17. `--sample` shares the data tree but is labelled everywhere.** Sample raw files are
named `*.sampleN.*`; the manifest, the connector state, `status`, `summary` and the quality
report all flag sample data. A sample of a CSV is its first N rows, fetched with a range
request, so sampling a 193 MB file costs a few kilobytes; TDC's pickle cannot be read
partially, so it is downloaded whole and N rows are drawn with a fixed seed.

**D18. TDC is loaded through PyTDC when installed, and through a restricted loader
otherwise.** PyTDC 1.1.15 pins `numpy<2`, `pandas<3` and `rdkit<2024.3.1` and does not
install on Python 3.13+. The file is always downloaded by this pipeline's client from the
Dataverse address PyTDC uses, into the folder PyTDC reads. Without PyTDC the pickle is read
by an unpickler that only allows plain pandas / numpy constructors, because a pickle can
otherwise run arbitrary code.

**D19. PubMed updates are incremental by entry date.** Each query remembers the last date
searched; the next run asks from two days before that, and articles are deduplicated by
PMID keeping the newest copy (which carries late retraction flags). ESearch goes through
the history server and is never cached, because a cached WebEnv would have expired.

**D20. Text mining is offline and rule-based.** Sentence segmentation and drug-mention
detection use rules and the synonym table: no model download, reproducible, auditable.
Synonyms that are ordinary words ("gold", "lead") or that name two drugs are dropped.

**D21. The mock-prediction seed contains no invented value.** It holds a random seed, the
real score distributions and real measured examples; the frontend generates placeholders
from those.

## Engineering

**D22. The project root is the folder the prompt was run in**, not a nested
`tujya-data/` directory: the brief says to start in an empty project folder, and that
folder is the editor's workspace.

**D23. Three dependencies beyond the brief's list:** `python-dotenv` (read `.env` without
mutating the environment), `pytest-asyncio` (async tests) and `hatchling` (build backend).
PubMed XML is parsed with the standard library; the bundled expat limits entity expansion.

**D24. Everything the pipeline produces is under `data/`, grouped by format.** The brief
puts `exports/`, `reports/` and `annotation/` at the project root and the tables in
`data/processed`. On request this became one folder with one sub-folder per format:
`data/parquet` (the processed tables), `data/csv` (coverage, conflicts, source agreement, the
two review queues, the annotation sample), `data/json` (frontend files and the JSON Lines
copy of the annotation sample) and `data/reports` (the quality report in Markdown and HTML,
the annotation guide). The extension of a file tells you its folder. `data/raw` and
`data/interim` keep their per-source structure: they are working layers, the same file name
occurs in several sources, and the manifest tracks them by path. All four output folders
follow `data_dir` (also with `--data-dir`); `parquet_dir`, `csv_dir`, `json_dir` and
`reports_dir` can point one of them elsewhere. In `manifest.json` the `layer` of an entry
(`processed`, `report`, `export`) still says what a file is, whatever folder it is in.
None of it is committed: the brief requires that for `data/`, and the derived files come
from sources with redistribution limits (PubMed abstracts, unlicensed O'Neil data).
`manifest.json` and `LICENSES.md` stay at the project root: they hold no data, describe the
folder, and can be committed.

**D25. `make` is not installed on the build machine (Windows).** The Makefile targets are
one command each; the equivalent commands were run directly and are listed in the README.
