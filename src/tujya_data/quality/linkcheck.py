FINDINGS = """## What was found while building the connectors

Measured on 2026-10-13 with the pipeline itself.

- **DrugComb**: the Zenodo record holds one file, `summary_table_v1.4.csv` (193 MB, CC BY 4.0,
  MD5 pinned in the connector). It has **no study and no tissue column**, so a row cannot be
  traced back to the screen it came from. Of its 1,175,220 rows, 709,187 are single-drug
  screens (second drug `NA`, synergy 0) and are skipped; 466,033 are combinations, covering
  4,150 drug names and 112 cell lines. The portal `drugcomb.org` did not answer at all
  (connection timeout); the data does not depend on it.
- **TDC**: PyTDC 1.1.15 pins `numpy<2`, `pandas<3` and `rdkit<2024.3.1`, so it does not
  install on Python 3.13+. The connector downloads the same Harvard Dataverse file PyTDC
  uses and reads it with a restricted loader when PyTDC is absent. TDC's `drugcomb` set
  (297,098 rows, 129 drug names, 59 cell lines) is a copy of the NCI-60 part of DrugComb:
  on the 286,674 combinations they share, the scores are identical.
- **O'Neil / DeepSynergy**: 23,052 rows, 38 drugs, 39 cell lines, Loewe only. The same
  experiments are inside DrugComb with scores recomputed by a different pipeline: on the
  22,737 shared combinations the two Loewe values correlate at only 0.42.
- **NCI-ALMANAC**: `dtp.cancer.gov` serves `Disallow: /` to every automated client, and the
  data files are attachments on `wiki.nci.nih.gov`, whose robots.txt disallows `/download/`.
  The pipeline requests neither; a person downloads the zip in a browser and places it under
  `data/manual/nci_almanac/`. The ALMANAC screen is also present inside DrugComb and TDC.
- **DepMap**: the portal API answers automated requests with a "verifying you are a person"
  page and asks not to be scraped. The connector uses the official Figshare+ release
  instead (documented API, MD5 checksums, CC BY 4.0), pinned to 24Q4 (2,105 models).
- **GDSC**: `cancerrxgene.org` answers **410 Gone**; GDSC moved into the Sanger DepMap. The
  optional connector reads the Cell Model Passports model list.
- **PubMed baseline**: `ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` serves `Disallow: /` in robots.txt, although
  NLM documents the server as its bulk download site. The optional connector therefore does
  not fetch from it and reads files placed under `data/manual/pubmed_baseline/`.
- **DDInter**: licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (non-commercial, share-alike). Disabled, and it
  refuses to download until `terms_acknowledged: true` is set.
- **DrugBank**: never requested by a connector. The site answers the link check with a
  Cloudflare challenge (403). The connector only reads a file a licensed user placed.
- **Documentation pages** (NCBI Bookshelf, PubChem docs, Europe PMC `RestfulWebService`,
  the Figshare+ record page) sit behind a browser check, a CAPTCHA or JavaScript. They are
  reported as such. The APIs themselves answer normally.
